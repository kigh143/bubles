# bubles
A simple html5 canvas example inspired by hackerbay. 

Greate art-piece of bubbles in motion with beautiful colors. these bubbles increase size on mousemove event. they increase size to radius of 40 if on near proximity with the mouse ( 50 pixels ). 

I would like to turn this into a game any good ideas are welcome thank you.
